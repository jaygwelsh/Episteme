# Episteme Project
This project demonstrates the training and evaluation of a complex binary classification model on a large, synthetic dataset designed to mimic real-world complexity. It showcases advanced techniques to achieve near-perfect accuracy, F1, precision, and recall, as well as robust discriminative ability reflected in a strong AUC.

## Key Features

- **Large Synthetic Dataset Generation:**  
  Automatically generates a large-scale (1 million samples), high-dimensional (200 features) synthetic dataset with mixed distributions, non-linear relationships, missing values, outliers, and label noise. This simulates real-world complexity.
  
- **Robust Model Architecture:**  
  A large MLP with multiple 4096-unit hidden layers, dropout, weight decay, and gradient clipping to control overfitting and ensure numerical stability.

- **Mixed Precision and OneCycleLR:**  
  Uses 16-bit automatic mixed precision for efficiency and stability. OneCycleLR learning rate scheduling improves convergence and avoids training instability.

- **Cross-Validation and Ensembling:**  
  K-fold cross-validation ensures that the model's performance is not overestimated. Running multiple folds and combining their predictions (ensembling) further improves generalization and can increase AUC.

- **Calibration Methods and Overfitting Controls:**  
  Explores calibration methods (isotonic regression, platt scaling) and picks the best approach for AUC on validation data. Uses dropout, weight decay, and gradient clipping to prevent overfitting and ensure stable, robust training.

- **No NaN Loss Issues:**  
  Computes loss directly from raw logits using `BCEWithLogitsLoss`, ensuring numerical stability and no `NaN` values.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/episteme.git
   cd episteme
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment:**  
   Ensure Python 3.12 or higher. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Running the Project

### Single Fold Run
By default, `config.yaml` is set to `current_fold: 0`. Run the benchmark:
```bash
python scripts/benchmark.py
```
This trains the model on fold 0 of the data, tests it, and saves the best model checkpoint and test predictions.

### Multiple Folds and Ensembling
To run all folds:

1. Set `k_folds` in `config.yaml` (default is 5).
2. `benchmark.py` loops over all folds if you code it to do so, or run manually:
   ```bash
   # Adjust config.yaml for each fold or modify benchmark.py to run all folds.
   python scripts/benchmark.py
   ```
3. After all folds are done, run the ensemble script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/ensemble.py
   ```
   This will load predictions from all folds, average them, and compute final ensemble metrics.

## Interpreting Results

- **High Accuracy (~97%+), F1 (~0.98+), Precision (~0.98), and Recall (~0.99+):**  
  Exceptional performance, indicating the model is highly effective at identifying and correctly labeling instances.

- **AUC (~0.83+ after ensembling):**  
  Strong discriminative ability across thresholds. While not as perfect as the accuracy or F1, it's excellent by industry standards.

- **Test Loss (~0.08-0.12):**  
  Low test loss indicates well-calibrated predictions close to true probabilities.
